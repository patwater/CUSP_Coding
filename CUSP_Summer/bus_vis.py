    # shapes and records, we may use the shapeRecords function as

        # where this street segment belongs, we just need to check if
        # its value is "New York" to determine if the segment belongs
        # to Manhattan.
        #
        # NOTE: NYC is divided into five boroughs, each belongs to a
        # different county: Manhattan (New York), Brooklyn (Kings),
        # Queens (Queens), Bronx (Bronx), Staten Island (Richmond).

        # It's time to draw the shape on our plot. A shape in a
        # shapefile consists a list of vertices (points) and a list of
        # parts which is a partition of the points, where each
        # partition should be rendered as an independent object. Each
        # partition is just an index number pointing to the location
        # of the point that marks the beginning of this partition. By
        # looking at a partition and the partition right after that,
        # we would know exactly the points that is needed to be
        # rendered for the first partition. For example, given:
        #
        # parts = [0, 16, 40]
        #
        # The first part would consist points 0 to 15
        # The second part would consists points 16 to 39
        # The third part would consists poitns 40 to the rest
        #
        # However, it should be noted that, the last part would not
        # have the information on "part after next" since it's the
        # last of the array. Therefore, we would create a new 'parts'
        # list, and append "-1" to the last element to make sure that
        # it knows its last element.
